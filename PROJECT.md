# PROJECT.md — Landing Page

## What This Is
A personal landing page for Nir Oz-Ari, educator and mentor.
Single HTML file (`index.html`). No frameworks, no build tools.

## Audience
A mix — students and parents looking for a tutor/teacher,
and schools or institutions checking me out professionally.

## Goal
Online presence. Not a hard sell — just a place people can
find me and get a feel for who I am.

## Design Decisions
- Dark theme with purple accents: modern, clean, fits the "thoughtful educator" vibe
- Animated particles and gradient name: adds personality without clutter
- Educator emoji in particles (📚 🎓 ✏️): ties the playfulness to teaching

## What to Build Next
- **Subjects / services section** — what I actually teach or offer
  (content TBD — ask Nir what subjects/levels before building)
